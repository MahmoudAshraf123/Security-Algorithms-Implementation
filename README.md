# -Security-
#### - project contain implementation of security algorithms (Encryption and Decryption) for each:
 1. General Ceaser.
 2. Monoalphabetic.
 3. Auto key vigenere.
 4. Repeating key Vigenere.
 5. PlayFair.
 6. Rail Fence of depth Level n.
 7. Columnar.
 8. Multiplicative Inverse using Extended Euclid’s.
 9. AES.

#### The solution consist of two projects:
 1. “SecurityLibrary”: a dll project that contain the implementation
 2. “SecurityPackageTest”: a unit test project that you will use to test the project.

#### To To test your code:
 1. Build the solution.
 2. Open test explorer (Test -> Windows -> Test explorer)
 3. TestALL
